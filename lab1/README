	Brief Summary: 

		In this lab, we focused on reviewing C as well as familiarizing ourselves with the terminal and command line arguments. 
		In the first part of the lab, we implemented a function that conisted of a sorting algorithm. In the second 
		part of the lab, we implemented a new main method which was used to sort a user inputted array of command line 
		arguments. Everything works.

	Question: 

		Suppose you were given an object module (with no access to source code) that sorted an array of integers very 
		efficiently. However, the sort function in the object module must be invoked with the following signature: 
		betterSort(int data[], first, last); where the array to sort is data and the parameters first and last give the 
		indices of the portion of the array that is to be sorted. How could you write a mySort() function with the signature 
		used in this lab that could exploit the better sorting function in the supplied object module? 

	Answer:

		void mySort(int d[], unsigned int n) {
			betterSort(d, 0, n - 1);
		}

		This modification to the mySort function calls the betterSort function which is meant to be a more efficient sorting 
		algorithm. The betterSort function takes three parameters, an array of integers, aswell as the first index and last 
		index which determine which part of the array will be sorted.
